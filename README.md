# Task1
-> In Task1 we had to write some programs using ananymous function and IIFE function to find 
 odd numbers in an array, palindrome, sum of numbers, title caps in an string, median of two sorted arrays. These were challenging and took lot of time to learn and find solutions for these. I took lot of time and effort to complete this by referring lot of websites.

 # Task2
 In Task2, as same in task1 we had been provide with same programs but here we have to use only arrow functions and solve these programs. But these arrow function concept was just explained yesterday in the class, I din't had much understanding in this arrow function. Then referred some docs and websites and tried to solve these problems.
